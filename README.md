# Deep Learning 2025

This repository contains my personal answers and submissions for the **Neural Networks and Deep Learning** course offered by the Department of Data Science at the Tehran Institute for Advanced Studies (TeIAS).

The course covers topics such as:

- Multi Layer Perceptrons  
- Convolutional Neural Networks  
- RNN for Time Series  
- NLP with Attention and Transformers  
- Autoencoders, GANs, Diffusion Models  
- Reinforcement Learning and DQN  

My responses are organized in separate Jupyter Notebook files, and the exercises provided by the teaching assistants are clearly referenced in each assignment.

## Repository Structure

- **Notebooks:** Each exercise is contained within a subfolder including its own Jupyter Notebook file and potential datasets required.

## Usage

To run the exercises locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deep-learning-2025.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the repository directory:**
   ```bash
   cd deep-learning-2025
   ```
3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```
4. **Open and run the notebooks:**  
   Select the notebook corresponding to the exercise you wish to review or work on.
